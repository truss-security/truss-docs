# Foundation Overview

The Truss Foundation is a Cayman non-profit foundation. It has been formed to facilitate the growth and adoption of the Truss Protocol, but not to manage or otherwise control the protocol. 

The Foundation's mission is to ease the burden of implementing actionable, timely and cost-effective security solutions by incentivizing the production and distribution of decentralized security resources.

The charter of the Foundation is as follows:
* Manage Foundation treasury
* Promote awareness and education of the Truss Protocol
* Develop tools enabling easier integration with Truss features
* Manage the structure and submission process as well as provide an impact statement on Truss Improvements Proposals (TIPs)
* Create and fund original code enhancements for the Truss Protocol and submit them as TIPs
* Fund other projects and bug bounties benefiting the ecosystem

The Foundation will be managed as a Decentralized Autonomous Consortia (DAC) driven by the voting and governance of Truss token holders.
