# Token Use Roadmap

The purpose of this document is to provide transparency to the community on how the Truss Foundation plans to use its Truss Token Treasury.

The Foundation will received TRUSS Tokens at Mainnet and will continue to receive tokens from Foundation reserves, on-chain fees and other activities.

The Foundation spends its Treasury to [execute on its charter](../foundation).

This document may change over time based on discussion with the Truss Board and the Truss Community.

## Currently Planned Uses of Truss Tokens

The Foundation has several uses for its token supply:

1. **Truss Security Product Giveaways:.** Promotional campaigns to pay for Truss security products and services for early adopters to encourage adoption. These tokens are programmatically locked from transfer and can only be used by the Foundation to pay for Truss resources (e.g, Truss Security Products). The Foundation will run campaigns with various Truss products whereby users can obtain a Truss Products so they can begin to utilize the great features of the Truss Protocol. While those are free to the end user, the Truss blockchain requires payment of Truss tokens which will be made out of a dedicated token pool.

1. **Truss Integration Incentives:** The Foundation may offer participation incentives to organizations and other entities that desire to integrate the Truss Protocol. 

1. **Partner and Ecosystem Incentives:** The Foundation intends to cooperate with other elements of the security and blockchain ecosystems including other protocols and intends to create some programs for enabling them to participate in the economics of the Truss Protocol.

1. **User Adoption Incentives:** The Foundation anticipates running contests and promotions from time to time that encourage users to interact with Truss Protocol features. Some of these will have prizes that are paid in Truss Tokens

1. **Foundation Operations:** The Foundation will have operational costs including but not limited to:
* Funding of proposed Truss Protocol and related SDK enhancements through contracts, grants and contests for the improvement of the Truss Protocol.
* Activities to build awareness and promote education about the Truss Protocol.
* Business development activities to work with additional prospective Truss Members and Partners to accelerate adoption of the Truss Protocol.
* Corporate, general, administrative and legal expenses.
* To fund these operations, the Foundation will sometimes compensate providers in Truss tokens. In other cases, the Foundation will sell Truss tokens through private transactions.


## Excluded Uses of Foundation Truss Tokens

* Foundation Truss Tokens will not be used in voting for Truss Board members.
* Foundation Truss Tokens will not be used in voting on any worker proposal or referendum systems developed in the future.
* Foundation will not stake its Truss Tokens.

## Governance of Foundation Truss Tokens

The Foundation is a Cayman non-profit entity with the mission of easing the burden of implementing actionable, timely and cost-effective security solutions by incentivizing the production and distribution of decentralized security resources. The Foundation is governed by a Board of Directors of up to nine persons. Those Board Members have the ultimate authority to decide on the use of Foundation Truss Tokens. On a day to day basis, the Board may delegate operational authority to the Managing Director of the Foundation.
