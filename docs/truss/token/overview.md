# Truss Token Overview

The Truss Protocol is powered by a utility token (TRUSS). The Truss Token is used to pay for transactions processed through the Truss Chain. 

Truss Tokens support the BIP-44 standard for hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets.

## Token Economics
* Maximum Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 TRUSS (38,506,000 of which are permanently locked)
* Decimals: 18
* No inflation beyond the Maximum Total Supply

Demand for Truss Tokens will arise from: 

* Users needing tokens for utility of the Truss Protocol (e.g. purchasing Truss Security products) 
* Individuals and entities desiring tokens for the purposes of voting
* Future enhancements to the Truss Protocol that are envisioned to create additional utility fees to be paid in FIO tokens.
