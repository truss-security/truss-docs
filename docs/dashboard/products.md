# Products Explorer

Welcome to the Products Explorer, your gateway to discovering and analyzing security intelligence. Think of this as your personal security research library, where each piece of intelligence is beautifully organized and easily accessible.

## Your Journey Through the Interface

### Starting Your Search
Imagine walking into a vast library with an intelligent assistant ready to help you find exactly what you need. That's your top navigation bar:

- Watch as your results update instantly with each selection

### Your Navigation Companion

Each filter acts like a lens, focusing your view on exactly what matters to you. As you click, the interface responds, refining your results in real-time.

**Each Card Reveals:**
- A compelling title describing the security finding
- The source and authors behind the discovery

Think of each card as a book cover that, when clicked, opens to reveal its full story in a detailed modal view.
